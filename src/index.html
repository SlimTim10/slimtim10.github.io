	<p>(rough) Hi, Iâ€™m Tim. I've been programming for a long time and teaching as well. I love both of them. My preferred mode of teaching is mentoring 1-on-1 because I feel like I can make the most impact that way. I am passionate about programming and I like to dive deep into the mathematics and philosophy behind it, like functional programming.</p>
