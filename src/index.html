            It has been such a great experience choosing Tim as my professional mentor during my career transition to Web Development. The learning environment Tim created for me as a mentee was welcoming, kind, flexible and effective. Tim is a person who loves to teach and enable his students. I think that makes a huge difference in the learning experience and what a mentee can take away. If you are looking to pivot your career in Web Development or are looking to update your skills, I would highly recommend Tim as a mentor.

            Tim is one of the best teachers/mentors I've had! He is very patient and is really good at understanding the unique needs of each student. He helps you find and consider possible solutions to the problem at hand rather than just giving you his answer. He has played a critical role in the professional development of hundreds of students including myself and I would feel privileged to get the opportunity to work with him again!

            It was wonderful to have Tim as an instructor when learning software development. He is an excellent listener and a patient teacher. I was impressed by his ability to explain difficult concepts, as well as his ability to help me break down problems. Tim does not tell you how to do something, he helps you build the knowledge and shows you the tools you need to continue as a developer by yourself. I wholeheartedly recommend Tim as a teacher and as a developer.
