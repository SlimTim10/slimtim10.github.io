	  Hi, I'm Tim. I help people enter or advance in the field of <strong>software development</strong> by <strong>remote mentoring</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I first fell down the rabbit hole of <strong>programming</strong> in 2005 and I don't plan to ever get out. It's taken me to the strange and interesting places of software security, embedded systems design, web development, functional programming, mathematical logic, and many more.
	</p>
	<p>
	  With over <strong>7 years</strong> of experience teaching programming, my specialty is making people feel comfortable. Learning something challenging and embarking on a new path can be stressful. Everything will be OK. You're going to make it and I'm going to help you get there. I've been called "the Bob Ross of coding".
