		  I'm a native Torontonian having lived in Canada my whole life and I've been passionate about programming for most of it.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		  I first discovered programming in my teens, picking up my father's lightly used books on Perl and C. With the books as guidance, I taught myself the basics of programming. The world of code and logic became a comforting place for my anxious mind. Through the support of online communities, I found as much fun in building things as breaking them. Software engineering quickly became my main interest and an obvious path for my future.

		  I followed the traditional path of studying computer science at the University of Toronto. Upon finding that university life was negatively impacting my mental health, I cut my studies short and co-founded a business with a focus on embedded systems. I lead the development of multiple hardware-based projects, developing and applying my expertise in firmware development, schematic design, PCB design, and prototyping.

          For my next venture, I pursued my passion in education by pivoting the business into an educational makerspace for kids and adults. I had the pleasure of planning and conducting lessons on the topics of electronics, programming, robotics, 3D printing, and PCB soldering. I also had the opportunity to instruct the members of the Toronto District School Board on using Arduino electronics as a part of the STEM initiative.

		  After resigning from my company and doing more work in web development, I decided to resume a career with a focus on teaching. I worked as an instructor and mentor at Lighthouse Labs for the web development bootcamp, where I discovered that my preferred and most effective method of teaching is 1-on-1 mentoring. I like to connect with each student and take a quality-over-quantity approach to teaching, ensuring mastery through a tailored approach.

		  When I'm not teaching or programming, you can likely find me rock climbing, rollerblading, foraging, caring for my pets, or playing piano.
