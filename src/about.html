		I'm a native Torontonian having lived in Canada my whole life and I've been passionate about programming for most of it.

		I first discovered programming in my teens, picking up my father's lightly used books on Perl and C. With the books as guidance, I taught myself the basics of programming. The world of code and logic became a comforting place for my anxious mind. I also joined online communities and found as much fun in building things as breaking them. Software development quickly became my main interest and an obvious path for my future.

		I followed the traditional path of studying computer science at the University of Toronto. Upon finding that university life was bad for my mental health, I cut my studies short and shifted to more productive ventures. I co-founded a business with a focus on embedded systems, where I lead the development of an accelerometer-gyroscope data logger for general-purpose use. I had to quickly learn the world of hardware electronics; where software meets the physical world. Most of my work involved the use of 16-bit MSP430 microcontrollers and MEMS sensors.

		My next project was forming and leading an educational makerspace for kids and adults. I had the pleasure of planning and conducting lessons on the topics of 3D printing, robotics, soldering, and programming. I also had the opportunity to assist the members of the Toronto District School Board in moving forward with their STEM initiative.

		After working in web development for a short time, I decided to focus on my other passion: teaching. I was an instructor and mentor at a web development bootcamp, where I discovered that my most effective method of teaching is 1-on-1 mentoring; I like to connect with each student and take a quality over quantity approach to teaching.

		When I'm not teaching or programming, you can likely find me rock climbing, rollerblading, foraging, drinking tea, and playing piano.
