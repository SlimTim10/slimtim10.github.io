	<h1>Private Mentoring</h1>
	<div>
	  <h2>Thinking about changing careers?</h2>
	  <p>
		There are many ways to start a career as a software developer: college, university, bootcamp, or self-taught. While those options might work for some people, in my experience most students benefit from a more tailored and flexible approach. That's why I choose to mentor 1-on-1.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The mentoring program caters to each student's individual needs and pace while following a tested and structured curriculum that is compatible with  industry trends. Private sessions are done via Zoom video calls and are typically 1 hour long. The recommended schedule is meeting twice a week. As your mentor, my role is to help you with:
		<ul>
		  <li>planning your projects,</li>
		  <li>having a good sense of reassurance that you're learning well and on the right path,</li>
		  <li>knowing what your next steps are,</li>
		  <li>reviewing your work, clarifying topics, assigning goals,</li>
		  <li>and being available for you to ask questions and get good explanations when you're stuck.</li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I advocate for project-focused learning wherever possible, so you will be learning real-world techniques and have a great portfolio to land your first job as a developer.

	  <h2>Are you a developer looking to upgrade your skills?</h2>
	  <p>
		It can be tough finding proper mentorship at work and even tougher getting your dream job. I can help you push through the barrier to take your skills to the next level. Whether it's database design, understanding a framework, practicing interviewing, or improving your portfolio, I can make sure you have a strong grasp of the topics to give you the confidence you need.

	<h1>Start Learning the Basics</h1>
	<p>While I was developing my curriculum, I found many resources online but the fundamentals of programming were not well explained, so I wrote a series of lessons to fill that gap. These lessons are best when paired with mentorship, but can also be used as a self-teaching tool or reference material.</p>

	<h1>Curriculum</h1>
	<p>
	  This is the standard path I recommend to anyone interested in becoming a web developer. I developed this curriculum over time, based on my institutional and private teaching experience. Most of the work is project-focused or hands-on exercises. This curriculum was developed with the idea of balancing industry needs and building strong foundational skills that you can carry throughout your career. Although the curriculum has a lot of structure and detail, one of the benefits of working with an experienced mentor is having the flexibility to change the curriculum based on personal interests and current trends. At the end of the day, there is no ideal path. It all comes down to making valuable use of your time and moving forward.
