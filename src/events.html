		Welcome to all aspiring and current web/software developers! Join me in a virtual meeting for free mentoring on a topic of your choice. First come first serve!

	  <p>
		Get help with a project, talk programming topics, practice interviewing, get career advice, or anything you want!

	  <p>Each participant gets 20 minutes (or more, if no one is in the queue) while spectators can take notes or chat. All sessions are recorded for my personal use.
